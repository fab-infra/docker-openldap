# This file (slapd.conf) is the static configuration file of OpenLDAP server daemon.
#
# OpenLDAP daemon (slapd.service) supports two configuration styles:
# - Simple configuration with this file
# - Online configuration (OLC)
#
# You may choose the configuration style by setting it in:
# /etc/sysconfig/openldap OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND="files|ldap"
# If the value is set to "files", this configuration file will be used.
# If the value is set to "ldap", this configuration file will be entirely ignored, and
# the OLC configuration from /etc/openldap/slapd.d will be loaded.
#
# If you decide to use online configuration, please read the additional instructions in:
# /etc/openldap/slapd.conf.olctemplate
#
# Feel free to customise this file according to your needs, and start OpenLDAP
# server daemon by executing:
# systemctl start slapd.service
#
# To verify that LDAP service is running properly, try the following command:
# ldapsearch -x -D cn=Manager,dc=my-domain,dc=com -w secret -s base namingContexts

#
# See slapd.conf(5) for details on configuration options.
# See /etc/openldap/slapd.conf.example for more examples.
# This file should NOT be world readable.

# If no ACL is present, everyone will be allowed to read the database.

# Using TLS to secure communication between LDAP clients and the server is strongly recommended.
# To enable TLS, you will need CA certificate, server certificate, and certificate key, and
# write down their paths below, make sure the files are readable by user "ldap".
# The server will then support StartTLS on standard port 389.
# To also serve LDAPS on port 636, set OPENLDAP_START_LDAPS="yes" in /etc/sysconfig/openldap.
